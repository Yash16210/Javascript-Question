JavaScript College Question

## What is This Project About?
Hey! This is a JavaScript Repositries I created for a college assignment. It's all about using JavaScript to solve some common problems. The project focuses on things like functions, loops, and arrays. The goal is to practice coding and applying JavaScript to real-world scenarios.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Examples**: I’ve added some examples you can try directly in the browser.
- **Simple and Clean Code**: The code is written in a way that’s easy to follow if you want to learn or modify it.
- **Problem-Solving**: Each part of the project is designed to help with understanding how JavaScript can be used to solve different challenges.

## What Do You Need?
- **A Browser**: You can just open the HTML file in any modern web browser.
- **Node.js (Optional)**: If you want to run the script outside the browser, you can use Node.js.
